# VBA-Challenge
In this challenge, I've created code that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

-The ticker symbol

-Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

-The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

-The total stock volume of the stock.

Also, I've added functionality to my code to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". 

The following images are representing the results:
